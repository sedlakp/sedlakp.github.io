# Colors and UI

_2023/11/11_

I am no expert on how to make a nice UI. I can do an ok UI at best. Nevertheless, here are some resources I use when making UI for an app or a website.

2. ## [Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com)

3. ## Color theory articles
Before reading a little bit about color theory, I had no idea what I was doing. Now I still have no idea what I am doing, but at least when I pick one color, I can find matching colors using HSB color system and the color wheel.
